# Fundamental of Datascience Introduction
1. Business uses RFID -> understand customer needs , direct their decision.
    - Customer profiling `/recommendation system/`
    - Trageted marketing
    - Workflow management
    - Store layout

## Problem: 
1. Size of data is inmense, tradisional methods no longer suitable for analyzing.
2. High dimensional nature of data, require new types of data analysis.

## What is `DATA MINING` ?
1. Autommatic discovery of useful information.
2. In large repository.
3. Use to find patterns in data.
4. To predict the outcome.

> How about database query is it data mining?
<br>Ans: no.

> How about Googling?
<br>Ans: no too.

## Knowledge Discovery in Databases
converting raw data -> useful information

  |  Data Selection| to select data for analysis|
  |  Data Transformation|to transform into stuitable data structures for mining|
  | Data mining | to apply methodology |
  | Pattern evaluation | to evalutate pattern, based on *interstingness* measures.|
  | Knowledge presentation | to visualise knowledge |


## Challenges
### Scalability
 - gigabytes,terabytes data
 - algorithm scalability
    - __searching__ algorithm/ strategy
    - __data structure__
    - __sampling__
    - __parallel__ or distributed algorithm.
### High dimensionality
- thousands of attributes
- traditional data analysis techniques design for low dimension
- computational complexity increases rapidly 
### Heterogeneous and complex data 
- traditional data analysis methods deal with same type
- recent year complex data objects emerge. (Eg. DNA, Webpage hyperlinks, climate data)
